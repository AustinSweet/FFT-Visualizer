Core goals: to utilize existing frameworks in order to best showcase an understanding of DSP code.

This program is a Hamming-algorithmic FFT visualizer tied to audio input. In order to demonstrate knowledge of DSP code, it is weighted towards a male vocal range, meaning that the visualizations will be most excited by a vocal range with peaks in the 500hz to 3500 hz range. It is also set to an extremely high refresh rate, so prolonged sounds will produce resonant holds while normal audio input will be quickly registered.
